Here I present some small (and feasible, on my laptop) projects of ML and DL. These are trained and tested using datasets that can be easily found online.

## Machine Learning ⚙️
🏠 House prices data $\rightarrow$ Simple linear regression.

🦠​ Breast cancer data $\rightarrow$ Logistic regression.​

## Neural Networks ​🌐
🚢​ Titanic dataset $\rightarrow$ Simple Neural Network implementation to predict if survive/not survive.​

## CNN and Computer Vision 🖼️
​🐶​ Pet dataset $\rightarrow$ I use the Oxford pet dataset to train a simple model able to classify dogs and cats.

👩🏻‍🦰​ Faces dataset $\rightarrow$ I use the CelebA dataset to train two types of models. One, very simple, that predicts if a person is Male/Female. Another, more complex, wich uses MobileNetV2 with fine tuning for a multi-label classification problem.

🌼 Flowers dataset $\rightarrow$ I use data augmentation techniques to solve an overfitting problem in a simple CNN.

📸​ Photos and videos $\rightarrow$ I use the pre-trained YOLO model (v8 nano) to perform object detection and classification on photos and videos.
