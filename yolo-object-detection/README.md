# Object Detection with YOLOv8

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates object detection using **YOLOv8 nano**, a fast and lightweight
real-time detection model.

The model is tested on:
- Images with people, animals and vehicles
- Urban street scenes
- Natural environments (boats)
- Video of a street (Video demo (YouTube): https://youtube.com/shorts/m9xqGtW6hRo?feature=share)
- Video of a domestic environment (Video demo (YouTube): https://youtube.com/shorts/GsxBhs2j2zo?feature=share)

## Model
- YOLOv8 Nano (Ultralytics)
- Pre-trained on COCO dataset

---

## Results
- Accurate detection of people, vehicles and objects
- Confidence scores correctly reflect prediction uncertainty
- Occasional low-confidence false positives, expected in real-world scenarios
