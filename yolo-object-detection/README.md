# Object Detection with YOLOv8

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates object detection using **YOLOv8 nano**, a fast and lightweight
real-time detection model.

The model is tested on:
- Images with people, animals and vehicles
- Urban street scenes
- Natural environments (boats)

---

## Model
- YOLOv8 Nano (Ultralytics)
- Pre-trained on COCO dataset

---

## Results
- Accurate detection of people, vehicles and objects
- Confidence scores correctly reflect prediction uncertainty
- Occasional low-confidence false positives, expected in real-world scenarios

---

## Technologies
- Python
- Ultralytics YOLOv8
- OpenCV
- PIL
- Matplotlib
